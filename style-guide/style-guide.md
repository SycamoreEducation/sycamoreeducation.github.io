# Purpose

The purpose of any coding style guide is to make sure that all the developers 
on a team are producing code that looks the same. Conventions boost efficiency 
whenever any developer has to work with another developer's code. When code 
looks and behaves in a predictable way, it reduces cognitive friction and helps 
us avoid errors.
